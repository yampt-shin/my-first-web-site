 A Cascading Style Sheet ( English : Cascading Style Sheet ) is a style language ( English : Style sheet language [ * ] ) that describes how the markup language is actually displayed [ 1 ] . It is mainly used for XHTML , but can also be used for XML . It is a W3C standard, and it has a high degree of freedom when defining layout and style.
 The default file name [2] is style.css.
 If a markup language (ex: HTML ) is in charge of the body of a website , CSS can be said to be in charge of decorating it like clothes and accessories. In other words, you can decorate it like a completely different website by leaving the HTML structure as it is and changing only the CSS file.
 In the case of CSS3 , which is currently under development , functions that can replace images created with graphic editing programs , such as shadow effect, gradation , and transformation, have been added. In addition, various animation functions have been added, replacing Adobe Flash to some extent.
